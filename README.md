On the Alarm Details screen from the main menu, the user can create an alarm and toggle a series of settings:

Name the alarm at the Alarm Label Edit Text

Choose a time picker time setting for the alarm to launch

Choose what days the alarm will play on the Alarm Repeat Days Fragment that launches from the repeat button 

Choose what specific feature they want to launch when the alarm intent launches, they do this by choosing an item on the options spinner (this feature is not implemented functionality yet due to time restrictions, currently only weather works )

They can choose when the alarm will vibrate the phone by clicking on the vibrate button. 

The List Floating Button from the main menu brings you to the List of Alarms Screen

At the List of Alarms Screen

The  Alarm Detail screen can be brought up either by clicking an alarm item on the List of Alarms page or by Clicking the Add alarm button on the main screen. 

If the user clicks on an Alarm Item on the list of alarms page the Alarm Details screen will be pre populated by the Alarm Details. Also the options menu will be inflated to allow for Alarm Deletion.
